#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
- Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deal with the development, maintenance and testing of softwares.
  IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWRAE ENGINEERING IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY:
  - It guarantees efficiency in production standards.
  - It provides robust security of sensitive user data, via encryption, authentication/authorization measures.
  - It gaurantees consistency/reliability in performance of aplication systems that support/enhance vital aspects of life.
  - It guarantees flexibility and scalability, such that optimal delivery remains stable, irrespective of workload size.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
- Mastering machine
- Mastering processes
- Mastering complexity

  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:

-Planning: Identifying the scope and purpose of a software.
-Coding:  This is the conversion of software designs into computer codes.
- Blueprint and building of frameworks.
- Requirement Analysis: this is figuring out consumer/user requirements.
- Testing: This is a close check up for bugs and glitches.
  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:

Waterfall Methodology:
- This has low flexibility
- testing is done at the end of development process
- customer feedback comes late as a result of late testing as mentioned above.
- its linear and sequential, because each stage is completed before moving on.

  AGILE METHODOLOGY
  -Its iterative and progressive with multiple sprints.
  - consistent customer feedback.
  - Testing is continous and done for each iteration.
  - Its highly flexible.

  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
-Software Developer:

*Developing and designing applications and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
*Maintaining and updating softwares to keep them functional.
*Giving reports and updates about the progress of the software development process to the project manager.

Quality Assurance Engineer:
*Analyzes software to identify bugs and give necessary guidelines to make them more efficient.
*create develi[pment procedures and standards for programmers to follow.
*develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

Project manager:
* Creates project template and blueprint.
* interfaces between client and soiftware developers.
* Delivers full fleshed software to clients and follows up with necesssary feedback mechanisms to track product performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
*Integrated Development Environments are software platforms that provide a workspaces for developing or debugging other software applications, with inbuilt tools that provides faster efficient coding experience. An example of such is Android Studio.
*Version control Systems on the other hand, are software tools that help developer teams manage changes to their source codes over time. Example of this is Git Repository.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
*Rapid technological Advancement: This creates the pressure on software engineers to stay updated  on current trends and frameworks.
*Changing Software Requirements : Software requirements are constantly changing from time to time, making it extremely challenging for developers to develop solutions that mett users' needs.

-Solution:
Research ways to counter Malware and phishing threats in the internet space.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:

- Unit Test: This method test methods, functions of classes used by a software. This is to ensure that each unit performs its role accurately and exclusively.
- Integration Test: Ensures that the respective modules used by a software application works together properly. as a single unit.
- System Test: This test is aimed at the entire software system as a whole, ensuring all functionalities and interactions sync properly.
- Acceptance Test: This is a formal test that verifies if a software system satisfy business demands. It requires the software to be running while test focuses on mimicking inconsistent, random user behaviour and how the software responds to this accordingly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:
-Prompt Engineering is a process whereby generative AI solutions are guided to generate desired outputs.
-Importance:
* It improves user experience.
* It give developers more control over users interaction with AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
Vague Prompt: Gemini, Give me the L.C.M of 3 special numbers.
Clear, Specific, Concise Prompt: Gemini, give me the L.C.M of 3, 5 and 7.

The improved prompt is more effective because it helps narrow down and eliminate wider suggestions or options that could possibly fit in to same prompt description. This make fore clear, definite and concise ouputs.
